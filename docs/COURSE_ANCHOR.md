# 🔒 COURSE ANCHOR – DATA GOVERNANCE ENFORCEMENT KERNEL

## Non-Negotiable Core Vision

I am building:

> A portable governance enforcement kernel  
> that plugs into execution environments  
> and publishes structured observability metadata  
> that feeds enterprise catalog + BI systems.

This is:
- The consultancy end product
- The reteachable course
- The architectural positioning
- The industry niche

This course must never deviate from this objective.

# 🧱 Architecture Layer Model (Locked)

L1 – Data Producers  
(API, DB, Kafka, CSV, SaaS, etc.)

L2 – Execution Layer  
(Python ETL, PySpark, Airflow, Streaming, Lambda)

L3 – Governance Enforcement Layer  
(Data Contract Engine – the kernel built in this course)

L4 – Observability & Reporting  
(PowerBI dashboards, SLA reporting, governance metrics)

L5 – Metadata Ecosystem  
(Purview, DataHub, Glossary, Taxonomy)

L6 – Enterprise Capability Map  
(Business capability alignment & audit mapping)

The kernel lives in L3.

# 📌 Course Phases (Locked Roadmap)

## Phase 1 – Governance Core (Local Python)
- Metadata block parsing (no enforcement)
- Standardized compatibility report schema
- Enforcement lifecycle documentation
- Freeze contract engine

## Phase 2 – AWS Module
- Rebuild ETL in S3 + Lambda/Glue
- Inject governance kernel
- Observe cloud design implications

## Phase 3 – Azure Module
- Compare Purview concepts
- Compare DataHub-style ecosystems
- Refine metadata abstraction layer

## Phase 4 – PowerBI Module
- Build governance dashboard
- Show impact tiers
- Show drift trends
- Show compliance rates

## Phase 5 – Post-Course Expansion (Only After Completion)
- TTL enforcement
- SLA logic
- ODCS YAML compatibility
- Registry abstraction
- Deep metadata integrations

# 🚨 Scope Discipline Rule

If a feature does NOT:
- Strengthen L3 portability
- Improve L3 integration into L2
- Improve L3 observability into L4
- Improve L3 abstraction toward L5

It is parked.

No deviation.

---

# 🎯 Completion Definition

The course is complete when:

- The governance kernel runs locally
- The kernel runs inside AWS execution
- The kernel produces structured compatibility metadata
- That metadata feeds a PowerBI governance dashboard
- The architecture can be taught and reused

Not when enterprise extras are built.

This document is the constitutional foundation of the course.
It must not be altered without deliberate architectural review.
